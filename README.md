# dads-business
Tinkering with a design for my father's side gig with teaching.
This is an additonal project I am working on for my father to add to my portfolio
I'm asking for anyone beginner to advanced who is interested to add or modify to my project.
This site will be made exclusively in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, and some Javscript and Jquery.
This is a non-live site, with the potential to becoming live for his business.
